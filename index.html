                    <h1>History of <b>the USA</b></h1>
                    <p>The United States of America, founded on July 4, 1776, emerged from thirteen British colonies seeking independence from Great Britain. The American War of Independence was fought from 1775 to 1783, culminating in the victory of the rebellious colonies and the formation of a new nation. In 1787, the United States Constitution was drafted, establishing a federal republic government and guaranteeing individual rights.</p>
                    <p>During the 19th and 20th centuries, the US expanded territorially westwards, faced a devastating civil war (1861-1865), and emerged as a global industrial and economic power. In the 20th century, it played crucial roles in the two world wars and the Cold War, consolidating its international influence.</p>
                    <p>The US is known for its cultural diversity, significant immigration, and role as a defender of individual rights and representative democracy. Today, it is one of the world's largest economies and continues to shape the global landscape in politics, economics, technology, and culture.</p>

                    <h2>Geography of the USA</h2>
                    <p>The geography of the United States is marked by vast diversity, influenced by its territorial extension, which makes it the fourth largest country in the world. Situated predominantly in North America, the United States shares borders with Canada to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west.
                    The country is home to a variety of ecosystems: temperate rainforests dominate the east and northwest coasts, while Florida is known for its swamps. The vast plains and the Mississippi-Missouri river system occupy the central region, followed by the imposing Rocky Mountains to the west of the plains. West of the Rockies, deserts and coastal zones complement the landscape, while temperate rainforests cover the northwest Pacific coast. Alaska adds an arctic region to the far north, while the volcanic islands of Hawaii further diversify the country's climate and geography.</p>
                    <h2 class="titulo">Economy</h2>
                    <p>The US economy is the largest in the world, with a nominal GDP estimated at over US$27.36 trillion in 2023, representing around 26.1% of the global economy. The country is highly developed, benefiting from abundant natural resources, a robust infrastructure, high levels of productivity and a well-educated workforce.
                    Historically, the American economy has maintained stable GDP growth, low unemployment rates and high levels of research and investment, both nationally and internationally. Despite significant inequalities, the US economy remains a dominant force on the global economic stage.</p>

                    <p>The United States is a federal presidential republic. At the federal level, executive power is exercised by the President, who is elected by an electoral college, legislative power belongs to Congress, and judicial power belongs to the courts. Each state also elects its own governor (chief executive) and congress.

                    <h2>Best time to visit of the USA</h2>
                    <p>The best times to visit the United States are spring (late March to late May) and fall (late September to late October). These are the seasons before and after summer, guaranteeing milder temperatures and fewer tourists in the most visited places.
                    From east to west, the United States stretches for 2,680 km - encompassing 5 different climate patterns across its territory. Therefore, the best time to travel to the United States really depends on the specific place you want to visit. If you don't already have a destination in mind, spring and fall are considered the best times to visit the United States.
                    From mid-March to the end of May, spring is synonymous with mild temperatures and beautiful natural landscapes in the national parks, forests and swamps of the southern states, such as California, Florida and Nevada. The northern states and cities take a while to get into the mood - but when they do, cities like New York, Washington D.C. and Chicago become popular urban destinations. Likewise, fall brings pleasant temperatures and stunning scenery to many parts of the country. For those who love outdoor activities such as hiking, biking and camping, these seasons are perfect for traveling.
